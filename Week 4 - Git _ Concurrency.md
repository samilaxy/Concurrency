# Week 4 - Git / Concurrency

### SDKs / Libraries, Git

-   You are familiar with the Unsplash API now. Review their Photopicker Library
-   Create your own library (you could call it a wrapper) for all their calls. Its responsible for just serving the json from their api calls.
-   Write a documentation for this library
-   Write tests for this library (I shouldn’t even mention it)
-   Add an example project to this library. (No need to create a complicated project for this, an activity/controller for each call all linked to a recycler view/tableview in the home screen)
-   When you’re done pushing to Git, add a tag and create a release.

### Threads

-   Create another project using this library.
-   Use Code (SwiftUI / Compose) to build your UI
-   Use Dispatch Groups, MultiThreading, GCD, Operations and XPC, Queues, Concurrency
